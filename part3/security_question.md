First of all it is mandatory to implement network policies and firewall rules to restrict traffic to and from your application, this can be done by using subneting configurations on our VPC and assigning security groups.
Due to number of employees in the project firts we must follow the principle of least privilege for your Kubernetes and AWS IAM roles and permissions, that is, grant only the minimum necessary access to resources for both applications and users.
Leveraging the AWS capabilities we must use AWS Secrets Manager (or Kubernetes Secrets ) to securely store and manage sensitive information like API keys, database passwords, and other credentials.
Now specifically for each aspect:
- As for the mobile app: securely store sensitive data on the device, considering data encryption, key management, and protections against data extraction through physical access. Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms designed for mobile devices, including biometric authentication, such as FaceID
- Frontend: we must use  HttpOnly cookies for session management, validate user input to prevent cross-site scripting or SQL injection and implement properly management of user sessions, including session timeouts, secure session storage, and token revocation.
- Database:we need to enforce the use of strong passwords by configuring password policies and setting appropriate password expiration periods
- API (backend): we must Implement strong authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access your API, and authorization system to control what authenticated users can do within the API. For example, use of JWT tokens or third party services or OAuth 2.0. And of course, serve the API over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, protecting it from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
